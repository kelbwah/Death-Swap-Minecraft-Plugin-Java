# Death-Swap-Minecraft-Plugin-Java
This is a simple plugin using the SpigotMC API and Java that imitates the famous death swap videos from Dream and GeorgeNotFound. I wanted to use spigot to replicate
the death swap feature that I've seen in various videos and let others use it as a plugin for their server if they want to! So feel free to use it and maybe add a bit 
more to the code!


Use these links in order to start your spigot server and then you can download the .jar file and place that into the plugin folder of your server:

Look at the plugin.yml file in the repo to see all the available commands to enable the plugin in your server once you are in the game.
